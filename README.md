Makers Academy Week One

### Introduction

To begin to use OOP, OOD, and TDD we modelled the London Boris Bikes network. The system had to be capable of: 

- Having a docking station to dock bikes
- Bikes must be able to be rented and returned
- Bikes can be broken and unavaiable for rental
- A garage can fix the bikes
- A van will transport the bikes between the garage and docking station 

### Process 

1. Make the Domain Model using CRC cards
2. Start with the smallest possible thing to model - the bike 
3. Build the docking station 
4. Build the garage 
5. Build the van 
6. Module extraction 

### Status

> * [x] = Done

* [x] Bike Created
* [x] Van Created
* [x] Garage Created
* [x] Docking Station Created


### What I learnt 

Greatly improved my OOP, TDD and OOD skills however there was still much to learn after this and the code is not fantastic. The code is not DRY and the testing is too tightly coupled to the code.
