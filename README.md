Makers Academy Week One

### Introduction

To begin to use OOP, OOD, and TDD we were asked to model the London Boris Bikes network. The system had to be capable of: 

- Having a docking station to dock bikes
- Bikes must be able to be rented and returned
- Bikes can be broken and unavaiable for rental
- A garage can fix the bikes
- A van will transport the bikes between the garage and docking station 

### Process 

1. Make the Domain Model using CRC cards
2. Start with the smallest possible thing to model - the bike 
3. Build the docking station 
4. Build the garage 
5. Build the van 
6. Module extraction
